# Space Invader HTML5

Code was inspired by Mary Rose Cook at Front Trends 2014 https://vimeo.com/105955605.
Project was heavily modified from there to demo usage in Facebook playable ad format

Usage:
- `npm run start` to start a local server
- `npm run build` to compile and generate the single HTML file in `/dist/index.html`
